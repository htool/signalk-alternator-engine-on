# signalk-alternator-engine-on

Detect whether vessel engine is running based on power generated by the alternator. Useful if you have a device for measuring alternator power/current, for example a Victron SmartShunt configured as a "DC meter".

Engine running state is useful for many other Signal K plugins, including:

* [signalk-hour-meter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/signalk-hour-meter) - keep track of engine hours
* [signalk-polar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/signalk-polar) - create dynamic polar tables for a sailing vessel when not motoring
